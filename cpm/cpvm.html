<h1>1000-CPvM</h2>
<br>
<b>CPvM</b><br>
<br>
CPvM is a compatibility layer that allows running many CP/M 2.2 applications natively on SymbOS.<br>
<br>
Not all CP/M software is supported (but a lot is). Applications for generic CP/M 2.2 on the 8080 or Z80 processors (i.e., CP/M-80) generally work best, while applications designed for other variants of CP/M or that expect low-level or platform-specific features (like special terminal features or block-level disk access) may not work at all.<br>
<br>

<h1>2000-Usage</h1>
<br>
<h2>2100-Basic Usage</h2>
<br>
<b>BASIC USAGE</b><br>
<br>
Running CPVM.COM directly will launch a live session of the CP/M command line (CCP) in SymShell. Applications can then be launched from this session as usual in CP/M.<br>
<br>
To run a single CP/M application directly, the application can be passed to CPvM as a command-line option. This is useful for creating desktop or start-menu links to CP/M applications, e.g.:<br>
<br>
    C:\CPM\CPVM.COM C:\CPMAPPS\MBASIC.COM<br>
<br>
In this "direct" mode, any subsequent parameters after the application name will be passed directly to the application as if entered from the CCP command-line.<br>
<br>
<b>NOTE: Do NOT close a CPvM session by clicking the "X" button on the SymShell window!</b> This will leave the CP/M application running in he background without properly closing it. Instead, first close the CP/M application, then the live CCP session (if active), and finally SymShell itself.<br>
<br>

<h2>2200-Files & Drives</h2>
<br>
<b>FILES & DRIVES</b><br>
<br>
Unlike CP/M emulators on many other platforms, the CPvM BDOS redirects file access requests to the SymbOS filesystem rather that emulating the CP/M filesystem directly. This allows CP/M applications to access files on FAT and AMSDOS-format disks as if they were on CP/M disks.<br>
<br>
CP/M 2.2 does not have a concept of directories, only disks (indicated by the letters A to P). To accommodate this, CPvM maps physical paths on the SymbOS filesystem to logical disk drives visible to the CP/M application. The default configuration is:<br>
<br>
<b>A:</b> the path of the executed .COM file (in "direct" mode) or the current shell path (in "live CCP" mode)<br>
<b>B:</b> root directory of physical drive A<br>
<b>C:</b> root directory of physical drive B<br>
etc.<br>
<br>
This handles the typical case of allowing CP/M applications to see files in their own directory while also accessing physical disks on demand. When running in "live CCP" mode, however, the physical paths of the first four logical drives (A-D) can be remapped by first navigating to the drive to be remapped, then using the "CD" command to set its physical path:<br>
<br>
    B:<br>
    CD C:\CPMAPPS<br>
<br>
Logical drive B will now show the files in the physical folder C:\CPMAPPS.<br>
<br>

<h2>2300-CCP Commands</h2>
<br>
<b>CCP COMMANDS</b><br>
<br>
In "live CCP" mode, CPvM emulates a subset of the CP/M 2.2 command line (CCP). Available CP/M commands are:<br>
<br>
<b>DIR</b> - display files on the current logical disk. Wildcards are allowed (DIR *.COM).<br>
<br>
<b>ERA file</b> - erase <b>file</b>. Wildcards are allowed (ERA ??FIL.*).<br>
<br>
<b>REN new=old</b> - rename file <b>old</b> to <b>new</b>. Wildcards are not allowed.<br>
<br>
<b>TYPE file</b> - display the contents of <b>file</b> to the terminal.<br>
<br>
<b>SAVE pages file</b> - save <b>pages</b>*256 bytes of memory (starting at 0x100) to <b>file</b>.<br>
<br>
<b>USER number</b> - set the system user number to <b>number</b>. (User numbers are not supported by the filesystem, so this does nothing except give the fake value to any CP/M app that needs it.)<br>
<br>
Additional control commands are also implemented:<br>
<br>
<b>EXIT</b> - quit to SymShell.<br>
<br>
<b>CLS</b> - clear the screen.<br>
<br>
<b>CD path</b> - set the current logical drive's physical path to <b>path</b>. (See <b>Files & Drives</b> above.)<br>
<br>

<h2>2400-Terminal Features</h2>
<br>
<b>TERMINAL FEATURES</b><br>
<br>
As usual for SymShell, terminal input/output will run much faster when SymShell is in fullscreen mode than when it is in windowed mode. Many fullscreen CP/M apps also expect the terminal to have the dimensions 80x24 characters (a bit larger than the default); this can be set from the SymShell menu bar.<br>
<br>
CP/M has no standardized features for advanced display management, like cursor placement; this was left to the terminal. Because so many different terminal types were available on the market, many major software packages could be configured for use with multiple different types of terminals. CPvM emulates the DEC VT-52 and ADM-3A terminals most completely, but also supports the most common VT-100/ANSI control codes. For configurable applications, you may need to try a few different terminal types to see which one works best for a given application.<br>
<br>

<h1>3000-Technical Details</h2>
<br>
<b>TECHNICAL DETAILS</b><br>
<br>
Because CP/M applications are not relocatable, CPvM runs each CP/M session in its own 64K statically-addressed memory bank. This allow multiple CP/M sessions to run simultaneously in the multitasking environment, but also uses a lot of memory. Therefore, CPvM will not run on a 128K system without expanded memory.<br>
