<h1>1000-CPvM</h2>
<br>
<b>CP\/M</b><br>
<br>
CPvM is a compatibility layer that allows running many CP/M 2.2 applications natively on SymbOS.<br>
<br>
Not all CP/M software is supported (but a lot is). Applications for generic CP/M 2.2 on the 8080 or Z80 processors (i.e., CP/M-80) generally work best, while applications designed for other variants of CP/M or that expect low-level or platform-specific features (like special terminal features or block-level disk access) may not work at all.<br>
<br>

<h1>2000-Usage</h1>
<br>
<h2>2100-Basic Usage</h2>
<br>
<b>BASIC USAGE</b><br>
<br>
Running CPVM.COM directly will launch a live session of the CP/M command line (CCP) in SymShell. Applications can then be launched from this session as usual in CP/M.<br>
<br>
To run a single CP/M application directly, the application can be passed to CPvM as a command-line option. This is useful for creating desktop or start-menu links to CP/M applications, e.g.:<br>
<br>
    C:\CPM\CPVM.COM C:\CPMAPPS\MBASIC.COM<br>
<br>
In this "direct" mode, any subsequent parameters after the application name will be passed directly to the application as if entered from the CCP command-line.<br>
<br>
<b>NOTE: Do NOT close a CPvM session by clicking the "X" button on the SymShell window!</b> This will leave the CP/M application running in he background without properly closing it. Instead, first close the CP/M application, then the live CCP session (if active), and finally SymShell itself.<br>
<br>

<h2>2200-Files & Drives</h2>
<br>
<b>FILES & DRIVES</b><br>
<br>
Unlike CP/M emulators on many other platforms, the CPvM BDOS redirects file access requests to the SymbOS filesystem rather that emulating the CP/M filesystem directly. This allows CP/M applications to access files on FAT and AMSDOS-format disks as if they were on CP/M disks.<br>
<br>
CP/M 2.2 does not have a concept of directories, only disks (indicated by the letters A to P). To accommodate this, CPvM maps physical paths on the SymbOS filesystem to logical disk drives visible to the CP/M application. The default configuration is:<br>
<br>
<b>A:</b> the path of the executed .COM file (in "direct" mode) or the current shell path (in "live CCP" mode)<br>
<b>B:</b> root directory of physical drive A<br>
<b>C:</b> root directory of physical drive B<br>
etc.<br>
<br>
This handles the typical case of allowing CP/M applications to see files in their own directory while also accessing physical disks on demand. When running in "live CCP" mode, however, the physical paths of the first four logical drives (A-D) can be remapped by first navigating to the drive to be remapped, then using the "CD" command to set its physical path:<br>
<br>
    B:<br>
    CD C:\CPMAPPS<br>
<br>
Logical drive B will now show the files in the physical folder C:\CPMAPPS.<br>
<br>

<h2>2300-CCP Commands</h2>
<br>
<b>CCP COMMANDS</b><br>
<br>
In "live CCP" mode, CPvM emulates a subset of the CP/M 2.2 command line (CCP). Available CP/M commands are:<br>
<br>
<b>DIR</b> - display files on the current logical disk. Wildcards are allowed (DIR *.COM).<br>
<br>
<b>ERA file</b> - erase <b>file</b>. Wildcards are allowed (ERA ??FIL.*).<br>
<br>
<b>REN new=old</b> - rename file <b>old</b> to <b>new</b>. Wildcards are not allowed.<br>
<br>
<b>TYPE file</b> - display the contents of <b>file</b> to the terminal.<br>
<br>
<b>SAVE pages file</b> - save <b>pages</b>*256 bytes of memory (starting at 0x100) to <b>file</b>.<br>
<br>
<b>USER number</b> - set the system user number to <b>number</b>. (User numbers are not supported by the filesystem, so this does nothing except give the fake value to any CP/M app that needs it.)<br>
<br>
Additional control commands are also implemented:<br>
<br>
<b>EXIT</b> - quit to SymShell.<br>
<br>
<b>CLS</b> - clear the screen.<br>
<br>
<b>CD path</b> - set the current logical drive's physical path to <b>path</b>. (See <u 2200>Files and Drives</u>.)<br>
<br>

<h2>2400-Terminal Features</h2>
<br>
<b>TERMINAL FEATURES</b><br>
<br>
As usual for SymShell, terminal input/output will run much faster when SymShell is in fullscreen mode than when it is in windowed mode. Many fullscreen CP/M apps also expect the terminal to have the dimensions 80x24 characters (a bit larger than the default); this can be set from the SymShell menu bar.<br>
<br>
CP/M 2.2 had no standardized features for advanced display management (like cursor placement); this was left to the terminal. Because so many different terminal types were available on the market, many major software packages could be configured for use with multiple different types of terminals. CPvM emulates the DEC VT-52 and ADM-3A terminals most completely, but also supports the most common Soroc IQ-120 and VT-100/ANSI control codes. For configurable applications, you may need to try a few different terminal types to see which one works best for a given application.<br>
<br>
Special keys were not standardized across terminals, so most CP/M software uses Ctrl+Key combinations instead of special keys. (Check each program's documentation for details.) For convenience, CPvM maps the arrow keys and delete/backspace onto the default WordStar keyboard shortcuts, the closest thing to a universal standard:<br>
<br>
Left            <t6>Ctrl+S<br>
Right           <t6>Ctrl+D<br>
Up              <t6>Ctrl+E<br>
Down            <t6>Ctrl+X<br>
Delete          <t6>Ctrl+G<br>
Backspace       <t6>Ctrl+H<br>
Tab             <t6>Ctrl+I<br>
<br>

<h2>3200-Troubleshooting</h2>
<br>
<b>TROUBLESHOOTING</b><br>
<br>
<b>Text output is slow or too small to read:</b> Try running SymShell in fullscreen mode (Alt+Enter).<br>
<br>
<b>A program crashes or does not run:</b> Not all CP/M software is compatible with CPvM.<br>
<br>
1) Verify that the program is designed for CP/M-80 2.2 (not CP/M Plus, CP/M 3, CP/M-86, or another version of CP/M).<br>
<br>
2) Verify that the program does not expect system-specific features or hardware (like modems), or direct block-level disk access.<br>
<br>
3) Try the program in a BDOS-level emulator like MockbaTheBorg's RunCPM (i.e., one that uses the native filesystem rather than running off of CP/M-formatted disk images). Programs that run correctly in this type of emulation are more likely to work in CPvM.<br>
<br>
<b>Screen output is garbled, with extra characters and text in the wrong places:</b> The program is most likely outputting terminal codes CPvM does not understand (see <u 2400>Terminal Features</u>). If the program provides an option to configure the terminal, try a different setting (e.g., ADM-3A).<br>
<br>
<b>Screen output is misaligned, miswrapped, or is not scrolling correctly:</b> The SymShell window is most likely set to a different size than the program expects. Most CP/M programs expect a terminal size of 80x24 or 80x25; change the SymShell window size to match (using the menu bar) and try again.<br>
<br>
NOTE: SymShell may not allow you to change the terminal size while CPvM is running. In this case, open a new SymShell window, change the size, and exit to save the setting as the new default. Subsequent SymShell windows will now start with the requested size.<br>
<br>
<b>Special keys (arrows, backspace, etc.) aren't doing what I expect:</b> Most CP/M software uses Ctrl+Key combinations rather than special keys. See <u 2400>Terminal Features</u> for a listing of the default keybindings in CPvM.<br>
<br>
<b>Running out of memory after running several apps in a row</b> (or: <b>CPvM is closed, but it still appears in the task manager):</b> Be sure to close CPvM correctly (by typing EXIT on the command-line, NOT by using the 'X' button!)<br>
<br>
<b>Bug reports:</b> If you find a program that (1) should work according to all of the above, (2) does not work, and (3) you actually care about getting it to work, bug reports may be emailed to p<b></b>r<b></b>e<b></b>v<b></b>t<b></b>e<b></b>n<b></b>e<b></b>t<b></b>@<b></b>g<b></b>m<b></b>a<b></b>i<b></b>l<b></b>.<b></b>c<b></b>o<b></b>m. Please include a copy of the non-working program (or instructions on how to obtain it) and step-by-step instructions for reproducing the problem.<br>
<br>

<h2>3300-Technical Details</h2>
<br>
<b>TECHNICAL DETAILS</b><br>
<br>
Because CP/M applications are not relocatable, CPvM runs each CP/M session in its own 64K statically-addressed memory bank. This allow multiple CP/M sessions to run simultaneously in the multitasking environment, but also uses a lot of memory. Therefore, CPvM will not run on a 128K system without expanded memory.<br>
